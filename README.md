# Development-of-an-advanced-autonomous-twoaxis-solar-tracking-system
Autonomous dual-axis solar tracker using actuator & stepper control, GPS/compass input, and SunPy-based sun positioning. Features Raspberry Piâ€“Arduino communication, MQTT/HTTP protocols, and a Node-RED dashboard for monitoring & control.

This project presents the design and implementation of a fully autonomous two-axis solar tracking system, integrating mechanical, electrical, and software components into a cohesive prototype. The system combines precision motor control (stepper motor and actuator) with real-time navigation input from GPS and compass sensors, enabling accurate orientation towards the sun. The solar position is calculated using a custom SolarPy algorithm, which determines azimuth and altitude angles based on geographic coordinates and time.

Communication between modules is handled through Node-RED with MQTT and serial protocols, while a dedicated user interface provides control, monitoring, and specialized operation modes. The mechanical structure was designed in SolidWorks, ensuring stability and reliability under wind and snow loads.

## CAD 
All mechanical components of the solar tracker were designed and modeled in SolidWorks, including the frame, base, and moving platform. The CAD work ensured correct integration of actuators and stepper motors, while load-bearing structures were dimensioned according to wind and snow load requirements. SolidWorks simulations were used to evaluate stresses, deflections, and safety factors, providing a reliable digital twin before prototyping. In addition, the software enabled the creation of assembly drawings and a complete Bill of Materials (BOM), which guided both sourcing and manufacturing.

## Userinterface
The user interface was developed in Node-RED to provide both monitoring and control of the solar tracker. It includes a control panel with multiple operating modes, such as WindSafe and SnowClear, as well as manual and autonomous tracking modes. Real-time data, including environmental conditions and system status, is automatically updated and visualized through dashboards. The interface also integrates mapping functionality to show location and orientation, while Node-RED manages communication between all modules via MQTT and serial protocols, ensuring seamless interaction across devices.

## SolarPy Algoritme
The SolarPy algorithm is the core of the autonomous tracking system, ensuring precise alignment of the panel with the sun. Using real-time GPS data (latitude, longitude, and UTC) combined with compass orientation, the algorithm calculates the solar azimuth and altitude angles based on astronomical formulas. These values are continuously transmitted via MQTT to the motor controllers, where the stepper motor adjusts the azimuth axis and the actuator regulates the altitude axis. Built-in error handling ensures stable operation during temporary data loss, while calibration offsets align the mathematical model with the physical system. Together, this provides accurate, robust, and real-time solar tracking that maximizes energy yield and adapts to environmental conditions.
